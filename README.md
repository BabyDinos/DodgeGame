# Hit!Hit

## What is Hit!Hit?

Hit!Hit is a casual game where you use your mouse to control a box, and collect circles of similar colors while avoiding those of different colors. Periodically, your box will change colors, so you will have to adapt and collect the right colored circles!

## How can you play?

Install and open the Hit!Hit.exe

### What I learned from this project

This being my first time working with C++, I had made some impressive strides within this short amount of time. For example, I: 

1. Learned about type declarations, pointers, references, the difference between stack and heap memory, and their strengths and weaknesses
2. Gained experience with Visual Studio, the process of linking and compiling code to create an executable, debugging, and memory management
3. Implemented OOP concepts in C++, including polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. 
4. Managed header and source files and worked extensively with C++ standard library and SDL
5. Navigated through a foreign environment, and using the resources available to me, assembled efficient solutions to address problems and seamlessly added features

### What I can improve on 

Despite my upcoming, I understand that there are many things that I can improve on. These include:

1. Understanding my limitations, as I just made the transition from Python to C++ and was too ambitious with the number of things I wanted to implement, without the knowledge, time, and resources to bring these ideas into reality
2. Organizing my project better, as there were times I was utterly lost with the number of files open, and the absurd amount of parameters my functions needed from different classes
3. Knowing more about Visual Studio as an IDE and how to use it with GitHub. In the future, I would like to utilize my IDE better to aid me in my coding endeavors and how to use GitHub to mark updates and important milestones.
